## 1.1.1

(i) If $\mathcal{F}_i$, $i\in I$ are $\sigma$-fields, then $\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{F}_i$ is. Here $I = \emptyset$ is an
arbitrary index set (i.e., possibly uncountable). (ii) Use the result in (i) to show that
if we are given a set $\Omega$ and a collection A of subsets of $\mathcal{A}$, then there is a smallest
$\sigma$-field containing $\mathcal{A}$. We will call this the $\sigma$-field generated by $\mathcal{A}$ and denote it
by $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$.

(i) Denote $\mathcal{F}:=\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{F}_i$. 

Take $A\in \mathcal{F}$, then $A\in \mathcal{F}_i$ for all $i=1,2,\ldots$. Then $A^C\in \mathcal{F}_i$ for all $i=1,2,\ldots$, because $\mathcal{F}_i$'s are $\sigma$-fields. Therefore, $A^C\in \bigcap_{i\in I}\mathcal{F}_i=\mathcal{F}$.

Take a countable sequence of sets $A_j\in \mathcal{F}$ for $j=1,2,\ldots$, then $A_j\in \mathcal{F}_i$ for all $i=1,2,\ldots$ and $j=1,2,\ldots$. Then $\bigcup_j A_j\in \mathcal{F}_i$ for $i=1,2,\ldots$. Therefore, $\bigcup_j A_j\in \bigcap_i\mathcal{F}_i=\mathcal{F}$.

Then we can conclude that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-field.

(ii) Define $\mathcal{F}$ to be the intersection of all $\sigma$-field that contains $\mathcal{A}$. Then by (i), $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-field. And by its definition, every $\sigma$-field that contains $\mathcal{F}$ contains $\mathcal{F}$. That means: $\mathcal{F}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-field containing $\mathcal{A}$.

## 1.1.2

Let $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$,$\mathcal{F} =$ all subsets so that $A$ or $A^C$ is countable, $P(A) = 0$ in the
first case and $= 1$ in the second. Show that $(\Omega,\mathcal{F}, P)$ is a probability space.

Proof: First we show that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-field:

Take $A\in \mathcal{F}$, then $A=(A^C)^C$ or $A$ is countable. This means that $A^C\in \mathcal{F}$.

Take a countable sequence of sets $A_i\in \mathcal{F}$ for all $i=1,2,\dots$. Then either $A_i$ or $A_i^C$ is countable. If all $A_i$'s are countable, then $\bigcup_i A_i$ is countable, because countable union of countable sets is still countable. Otherwise, there exists uncountable $A_j$ for some $j$, then we have $A_j^C$ is countable. Then $(\bigcup_i A_i)^C=\bigcap_i A_i^C\subset A_j^C$ is countable. Then $\bigcup_i A_i\in \mathcal{F}$.

Therefore, $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-field.

Second, we show that $P$ is a measure:

For any $A\in \mathcal{F}$, $P(A)\geq 0=P(\emptyset)$ by the definition of $P$. Take a countable sequence of disjoint sets $A_i\in \mathcal{F}$. If all $A_i$'s are countable, then $\bigcup_i A_i$ is also countable. Then $P(\bigcup_i A_i)=0$, and $P(A_i)=0$ for all $i$. Therefore, we have $P(\bigcup_iA_i)=0=\sum_iP(A_i)$. Otherwise, there exists an uncountable $A_j$ for some $j$. Because $A_i$'s are disjoint, $A_i\subset A_j^C$ for all $i\neq j$. $A_j\in \mathcal{F}$ and $A_j$ is uncountable, then $A_j^C$ is countable. Then $A_i\subset A_j^C$ is countable for all $i\neq j$, which means that $P(A_j)=1$ and $P(A_i)=0$ for all $i\neq j$. Moreover, we have $A_j\subset \bigcup_i A_i$, and therefore, $\bigcup_i A_i$ is uncountable, and then $P(\bigcup_i A_i)=1$. Then we have $P(\bigcup_i A_i)=1=1+0=P(A_j)+\sum_{i\neq j}P(A_i)=\sum_i P(A_i)$.

Therefore, $P$ is a measure with $P(\Omega)=P(\mathbb{R})=1$. Then $P$ is a probability.
